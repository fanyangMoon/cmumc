        <h2> Research Opportunities </h2>
        <p>
        Steve Miller, who was an out-of-town speaker at math club last year in the spring, is coming to CMU while he's on sabbatical. He's going to be teaching an undergrad research class that's going to be awesome. He's really good at supervising undergrad research and if you commit to working hard, you will get a publication out of it.

        If anyone has any questions about doing research with Steve Miller you can refer them to me. I'll be happy to field questions!
        <br>
        Thanks,
        <br>

        <h2> Career Opportunities </h2>
        <p>
        Here is information about companies that specifically contact us with positions that may be interesting for mathematically-minded people.

        <ul>
          <li> TransMarket Group </li>
          We are a rapidly expanding quantitative trading firm, and feel your club members are an ideal fit for our team. We are looking to grow by up to 50% this year, and are hiring both interns and full time employees.

          Culturally, we consider ourselves to be a cross between a tech firm and an ibank- with overall compensation typically being higher than both. More importantly- the level of ownership and career progression is closer to that of a start up.

        <ul>
          <li> Deutsche Bank </li>
          Deutsche Bank is trying to target a new audience of students this year outside of the business school. We will be hosting an information session, like many other banks, but this year we decided to host an additional event to target students that might not know a lot about financial services.
