        Imagine you have a finite set of particles, moving along the x axis, with
        fixed masses and initial velocities. When two particles collide, they
        *stick* together to form a new particle, preserving the mass and momentum
        of the original two. This is a simple set-up, but seems potentially
        difficult to work with mathematically. Adam shows you how you can use math
        to study this system in a way that makes it much more understandable.

        We explore in depth the theoretic and statistical properties of
        certain sets of numbers arising from their Cantor series expansions.
        As a direct consequence of our main theorem we deduce numerous new
        results as well as strengthen known ones.  This work was coauthored
        with Dylan Airey while he was still a high school student at the
        Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science. Our main theorem
        will touch on issues related to computability theory, ergodic theory,
        fractal geometry, number theory, and probability theory.

        Many systems exhibit a digit bias. For example, the first digit
        base 10 of the Fibonacci numbers or of 2^n equals 1 about 30% of
        the time; the IRS uses this digit bias to detect fraudulent corporate tax
        returns.
        This phenomenon, known as Benford s Law, was first noticed by
        observing which pages of log tables were most worn from age &#8211 it is a good
        thing there were no calculators 100 years ago! We will discuss the general
        theory and application, talk about some fun examples (ranging from the 3x1
        problem to the Riemann zeta function), and if time permits discuss
        some joint results with my REU students.

        The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is one of the Millennium
        Problems. The conjecture relates the group of rational points on an
        elliptic curve to information associated with the equation for the
        elliptic curve over finite fields.
        In the talk, we will see some of setup for the conjecture, the
        statement and some of the partial progress made. I will basically
        assume David's talk last time as a prerequisite, but I will briefly
        go over the facts about elliptic curves he mentioned that we will
        need.

        A positive integer N is called congruent if it is the area of a
        right triangle whose sides have rational lengths. Determining
        whether or not a given positive integer is congruent is a
        millennia-old problem that is still open today. I will explore this
        problem and several attempted solutions, including an interesting
        modern approach using elliptic curves.

        If you are speaking with an alien from Mars who knows a lot of
        math and has never heard the word Euclid, explaining what
        geometry is can be frustrating. You will try very hard to come up
        with foolproof ways to axiomatize geometry, and the alien will
        persist in coming up with bizarre structures that look nothing
        like what you imagined.

        In 1899, Hilbert came up with a set of 16 alien-proof axioms for
        plane geometry. (That is not quite true. He had 17. But thereâ€™s
        been some progress in the intervening century.) In this talk, I
        will play the role of the alien in an effort to persuade you that
        the task of Hilbert was not an easy one.

        This year, problem 6 on the International Math Olympiad turned out to be a
        semi-open research problem.  The originally proposed problem is solvable
        using basic methods, but it is still open to determine the best possible
        result.  A set of lines in the plane is in general position if no two are
        parallel and no three are concurrent.  A set of lines in general position
        cuts the plane into cells, some of which have finite area; we call these
        finite cells.  Prove that for all sufficiently large $n$, in any set of $n$
        lines in general position it is possible to color at least $\sqrt{n}$ of
        the lines blue in such a way that none of its finite cells has a completely
        blue boundary.  What's the best bound that you can get?  We'll improve the
        stated bound using techniques from probabilistic combinatorics and extremal
        hypergraph theory.

          <p> A biphase approximation of an image is a two-color piecewise-constant approximation of the original image which maximizes regional fidelity while minimizing complicated boundaries.  When it comes to segmenting images, human intuition is very strong.  We often have strong gut feelings about which pixels belong in which regions, where object boundaries should be, and what should be discounted as noise or damage.  Variational image segmentation seeks to formalize these "gut feelings" by creating a functional which quantifies the error of approximation, and then defining correct segmentations as local minima of this functional.  In this talk, I will discuss the intuition behind variational image approaches, popular region-based segmentation methods including the Chan-Vese model, and my group's summer research into a segmentation method which dynamically identifies artifacts and corrects shadows.

          <p> An elementary cellular automaton is a sort of computational model. States are sequences of bits. Transitions between states are specified by a simple, deterministic rule that updates each bit according to a small neighborhood around that bit in the previous state. Even though the model is simple to describe, many cellular automata have surprisingly beautiful and complicated behavior. In some cases their behavior is so unpredictable that it might be called "random," even though there is no randomness in the system. In this talk I will show why several automata exhibit chaotic behavior, for a popular definition of chaos.

          <p> Why are differential equations so ubiquitous?  It seems that all
          physical systems are described by a set of differential equations.
          Perhaps we should stop and ask why? In this talk I will explain
          how a certain set of fundamental principle that apply to all physical
          systems automatically lead to differential equations (DE's) as equations of
          motion, as opposed to say integral equations. I will also discuss how
          the symmetries of physical systems, and their corresponding DE's,
          naturally lead to solutions via the use of group theory.  Finally I will
          discuss how the principle of observer independence leads to the
          idea of differential geometry.
