        The transcendental numbers are the atoms of the number line --- they are everywhere, but few have seen one. No longer you will have to believe in the existence of these half-mythical numbers! I will arm you with the knowledge that will enable you to write a number down, and prove to your cat that it is transcendental!

        This year, problem 6 on the International Math Olympiad turned out to be a
        semi-open research problem.  The originally proposed problem is solvable
        using basic methods, but it is still open to determine the best possible
        result.  A set of lines in the plane is in general position if no two are
        parallel and no three are concurrent.  A set of lines in general position
        cuts the plane into cells, some of which have finite area; we call these
        finite cells.  Prove that for all sufficiently large $n$, in any set of $n$
        lines in general position it is possible to color at least $\sqrt{n}$ of
        the lines blue in such a way that none of its finite cells has a completely
        blue boundary.  What's the best bound that you can get?  We'll improve the
        stated bound using techniques from probabilistic combinatorics and extremal
        hypergraph theory.

          <p> A biphase approximation of an image is a two-color piecewise-constant approximation of the original image which maximizes regional fidelity while minimizing complicated boundaries.  When it comes to segmenting images, human intuition is very strong.  We often have strong gut feelings about which pixels belong in which regions, where object boundaries should be, and what should be discounted as noise or damage.  Variational image segmentation seeks to formalize these "gut feelings" by creating a functional which quantifies the error of approximation, and then defining correct segmentations as local minima of this functional.  In this talk, I will discuss the intuition behind variational image approaches, popular region-based segmentation methods including the Chan-Vese model, and my group's summer research into a segmentation method which dynamically identifies artifacts and corrects shadows.

          <p> An elementary cellular automaton is a sort of computational model. States are sequences of bits. Transitions between states are specified by a simple, deterministic rule that updates each bit according to a small neighborhood around that bit in the previous state. Even though the model is simple to describe, many cellular automata have surprisingly beautiful and complicated behavior. In some cases their behavior is so unpredictable that it might be called "random," even though there is no randomness in the system. In this talk I will show why several automata exhibit chaotic behavior, for a popular definition of chaos.

          <p> Why are differential equations so ubiquitous?  It seems that all
          physical systems are described by a set of differential equations.
          Perhaps we should stop and ask why? In this talk I will explain
          how a certain set of fundamental principle that apply to all physical
          systems automatically lead to differential equations (DE's) as equations of
          motion, as opposed to say integral equations. I will also discuss how
          the symmetries of physical systems, and their corresponding DE's,
          naturally lead to solutions via the use of group theory.  Finally I will
          discuss how the principle of observer independence leads to the
          idea of differential geometry.
