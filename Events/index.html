              Is sine of 1 degree rational?   At a glance this question seems light years away from quantum computing, a cutting-edge research area where computer science meets quantum mechanics. Surprisingly, this question matters not only in the mathematical world, but also in the quantum realm.  Its answer and many other rudimentary facts of trigonometry have found their way into the study of various research problems in quantum computing.  In this talk we will explore these intriguing connections through the interplay of quantum algorithms and topics from number theory and classical analysis.  Along the way, we will solve a long-standing puzzle in quantum search and provide a quantum approach to the centuries-old Basel problem.

              The idea of equipping a set with a structure is ubiquitous in mathematics. For example, graphs are sets equipped with an edge relation, groups are sets equipped with an algebraic structure, topological spaces are sets equipped with a notion of openness, posets are sets equipped with a notion of order... the list goes on forever and ever and ever. This talk will introduce a candidate for defining 'structure' in the abstract. With the tools we develop, we can prove some pretty cool stuff in enumerative combinatorics. </td></tr>

              Supposedly our intuition about probability---even though humans invented the concept---is faulty. Lots of puzzles, naturally, are designed to lead us down the garden path to incorrect conclusions. But maybe our intuition is not as bad as we think. We'll take a fresh look at some paradoxes, old and new, to see whether we or our assumptions are at fault.

                      The peculiar properties of a shape-memory alloy are the result of the fine structure formed between its several crystalline forms. How do these fine structures arise from basic ideas about a crystal? In this talk, I will explain how infinitely fine structures are a natural consequence of integral minimization problems, as well as the project I worked on at Oxford this summer.

                                What's the longest sequence of triples (x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2), ... that satisfies the following properties?
                                (1) Each number is an integer between 1 and N inclusive.
                                (2) For every j less than k, if we compare the triples (x_j, y_j, z_j) and (x_k, y_k, z_k), there are at least two coordinates in which the latter triple strictly exceeds the former triple.

                                It turns out that this simple-sounding problem is equivalent to a question from Ramsey Theory, inspired by a question from k-majority tournaments, and related to deep question involving induced matchings and Szemeredi&#39 s Regularity Lemma.

                                The talk will be a tour of Combinatorics which introduces many of these concepts along the way.

                                Imagine you have a finite set of particles, moving along the x axis, with
                                fixed masses and initial velocities. When two particles collide, they
                                *stick* together to form a new particle, preserving the mass and momentum
                                of the original two. This is a simple set-up, but seems potentially
                                difficult to work with mathematically. Adam shows you how you can use math
                                to study this system in a way that makes it much more understandable.

                                Many systems exhibit a digit bias. For example, the first digit

                                the time; the IRS uses this digit bias to detect fraudulent corporate tax

                                elliptic curve over finite fields.

                                If you are speaking with an alien from Mars who knows a lot of
                                math and has never heard the word Euclid, explaining what
                                geometry is can be frustrating. You will try very hard to come up
                                with foolproof ways to axiomatize geometry, and the alien will
                                persist in coming up with bizarre structures that look nothing
                                like what you imagined.

                                In 1899, Hilbert came up with a set of 16 alien-proof axioms for
                                plane geometry. (That is not quite true. He had 17. But there’s
                                been some progress in the intervening century.) In this talk, I
                                will play the role of the alien in an effort to persuade you that
                                the task of Hilbert was not an easy one.

                                This year, problem 6 on the International Math Olympiad turned out to be a
                                semi-open research problem.  The originally proposed problem is solvable
                                using basic methods, but it is still open to determine the best possible
                                result.  A set of lines in the plane is in general position if no two are
                                parallel and no three are concurrent.  A set of lines in general position
                                cuts the plane into cells, some of which have finite area; we call these
                                finite cells.  Prove that for all sufficiently large $n$, in any set of $n$
                                lines in general position it is possible to color at least $\sqrt{n}$ of
                                the lines blue in such a way that none of its finite cells has a completely
                                blue boundary.  What's the best bound that you can get?  We'll improve the
                                stated bound using techniques from probabilistic combinatorics and extremal
                                hypergraph theory.

                                  <p> A biphase approximation of an image is a two-color piecewise-constant approximation of the original image which maximizes regional fidelity while minimizing complicated boundaries.  When it comes to segmenting images, human intuition is very strong.  We often have strong gut feelings about which pixels belong in which regions, where object boundaries should be, and what should be discounted as noise or damage.  Variational image segmentation seeks to formalize these "gut feelings" by creating a functional which quantifies the error of approximation, and then defining correct segmentations as local minima of this functional.  In this talk, I will discuss the intuition behind variational image approaches, popular region-based segmentation methods including the Chan-Vese model, and my group's summer research into a segmentation method which dynamically identifies artifacts and corrects shadows.

                                  <p> An elementary cellular automaton is a sort of computational model. States are sequences of bits. Transitions between states are specified by a simple, deterministic rule that updates each bit according to a small neighborhood around that bit in the previous state. Even though the model is simple to describe, many cellular automata have surprisingly beautiful and complicated behavior. In some cases their behavior is so unpredictable that it might be called "random," even though there is no randomness in the system. In this talk I will show why several automata exhibit chaotic behavior, for a popular definition of chaos.

                                  <p> Why are differential equations so ubiquitous?  It seems that all
                                  physical systems are described by a set of differential equations.
                                  Perhaps we should stop and ask why? In this talk I will explain
                                  how a certain set of fundamental principle that apply to all physical
                                  systems automatically lead to differential equations (DE's) as equations of
                                  motion, as opposed to say integral equations. I will also discuss how
                                  the symmetries of physical systems, and their corresponding DE's,
                                  naturally lead to solutions via the use of group theory.  Finally I will
                                  discuss how the principle of observer independence leads to the
                                  idea of differential geometry.
