    <h2> About </h2>

	       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carnegie Mellon Math Competition (CMMC) is a new national math competition for high school students. The competition is organized by members of the <a href="../index.html"> Carnegie Mellon University Math Club</a> (CMUMC). It will be held at Carnegie Mellon on March 28. There will be an individual round, a proof-based team round, and a special team round. The topics covered will be geometry, algebra, number theory, combinatorics, and algorithms. A full team will consist of five members. Individuals may also sign up and submit team member preferences in the case of a partial team, and we will form teams from the individuals. </p>

    <h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2>


  <p>
    <b> Q: </b>
    When will registration open?
    <br>
    <b> A: </b>
      Registration will open sometime near the end of the calendar year.
  </p>


<p>
  <b> Q: </b>
  Who can participate?
  <br>

  <b> A: </b>
   A team can consist of any five current US high school students, but teams are encouraged to be five students from the same school.
</p>

<p>
  <b> Q: </b>
What is the special round like?
  <br>
  <b> A: </b>
  We are still working on the details. Once they are worked out, we will update the website with more information.
</p>



  <p>
    <b> Q: </b>
    Will there be a separate division for local teams?
    <br>
    <b> A: </b>
    We do not yet know who will be attending. If there are many teams that are not local, and if we judge it necessary, there will be separate awards for local teams and for national teams.
  </p>

<p>
  <b> Q: </b>
What counts as local?
  <br>
  <b> A: </b>
Any team where all team members live within 100 miles of CMU is considered local.
</p>

<p>
  <b> Q: </b>
Do I need to know how to program to be able to solve the questions about algorithms?
  <br>

  <b> A: </b>
 No. While algorithms are more commonly seen in the setting of computer science, the questions about algorithms will be mathematical in nature and will require no knowledge of any programming language.
</p>
<p>
  <b> Q: </b>
When will your website have more information?
  <br>
  <b> A: </b>
 We will update the website with more information when registration opens.
</p>

<p>
  <b> Q: </b>
I am a CMU student and I want to get involved! How can I do so?
  <br>

  <b> A: </b>
  Send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:treiter@andrew.cmu.edu">treiter@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.
